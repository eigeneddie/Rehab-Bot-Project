1. incorporate time in single command passive mode (millis) for the duration part of the program
2. how to get switch between target_reference = maxAngle or minAngle when we arrive at target_reference
3. stop the program when duration of exercise is achieved
4. stop the program when duration is not achieve but "-s" is received
5. how to update maxMotor speeed to pid_execute
6. note: passive mode must work on single or continuous command

strategy: 
	- update target_reference in void loop
	- if else statement in void loop to evaluate whether we arrive at target already or not
	- change target_reference
