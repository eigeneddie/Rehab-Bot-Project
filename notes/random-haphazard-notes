Haphazard notes

1. isometric does not need spring-damper parameter: only position control (for the case of stepper, this is very easy: just hold the current position)
2. isometric menu selection: position 1, 2 or 3, instead of environment 1, 2, 3.
3. figure out a way to independently measure position for system testing
4. monday/tueday, let's try if there's no damping and underdamped system (expected to have oscillations)
5. review intuition of PID (will be used for designing the passive mode controller). root locus may be an option as well. but who knows.

6. assistive mode: the system detects the trajectory. when the system detects that the force provided
  by patient is not enough to achieve said trajectory, an assistive control is engaged
7. start writing the assistive control term in the raspberry pi program.


For thesis document
------------------
analysis flow: 
1. DRO (translating requirement to achievable objectives)
2. design strategy
3. mechanism selection: (energy consideration), conclusion: no difference, choose 4 bar
4. mechanical design and sizing of components based on what's accessible to the author
5. design of haptic system: stability of system to choose which is the suitable damping/spring constant
6. justifying 10 Hz (100 ms) sampling time


Testing of device:
-Given we have a linear sensor to detect the slider distance
1. Test the compliance control parameters (c, k) in terms of percent error
    Stiffnes: desired stiffness vs measured stiffness (measured F and m)
    Damping: desired damping vs measured damping (measured F and v)
2. How do you apply the force?
