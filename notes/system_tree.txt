SYSTEM TREE OF REHAB-BOT

1. user interface: TFT LCD Arduino shield 

2. high-level module (overall system)
    -> sensor interface (load cell, angle sensor, distance sensor)
    -> user interface communication (change mode)
    -> detailed program: passive mode
        -> kinematic calculation between joints
        -> Cosine rule of calculating joint angle
    -> detailed program: assistive mode
        -> assistive constant
        -> spring & dampers

    -> detailed program: active mode
        -> training sub-mode
        -> spring & dampers
    
3. low-level module (actuator)
    -> execute position control (executed by all modes)
    -> actual working actuator
    
4. mechanical part sisa
    -> mechanical frame and sensor attachment
    -> footrest
    -> cushion for user comfort
