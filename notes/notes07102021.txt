- Make a new angle sensor shaft from 3D printing.
- Full speed ahead for the passive and assistive control codes, deadline: 12 Okt 2021
- install limit switches actuated by low level controller

Low level controller function:

During active mode (either full or semi):
1. accept position command from raspberry pi
2. actuate the motor

During passive mode:
1. when user set current angle, motor immediately goes to the corresponding angle 
	-> Serial communication
		->keep sending info about the current angle to raspberry 			  pi, and raspberry pi keeps sending command to arduino
		->when the parameters are set, 

2. when system is set to go, the system does the passive routine based on the parameters sent to the raspberry pi -> arduino.
3. The execution of passive training routine is done solely by the arduino
4. as the training goes, we could stop in the middle
5. if we don't stop the training as it progresses, the passive training will proceed until it finishes with the training.
6.
